# PDF Invoices From xlsx Files

Python script that converts xlsx files into PDF invoices. Since the script does not support dynamic data structures, the xlsx file must have a certain structure with specific column names (product_id, product_name, amount_purchased, price_per_unit, total_price) and specific names. To learn more, see xlsx files. PDF invoices containing a table containing all the products, the total cost, the invoice number, and the date will be generated from those xlsx files.
